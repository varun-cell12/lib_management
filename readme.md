# Library Management System (CSV-based)

## Overview
This is a simple console-based Library Management System implemented in Python.  
It allows a user to manage book records stored in a CSV file using a menu‑driven interface.

## Features
- Add a new book record (Create)
- Modify an existing book record (Update)
- Delete an existing book record (Delete)
- Search a book by its ID (Read)
- List all books in the library (Read)

These features together implement basic CRUD operations on book data.

## Technologies / Tools Used
- Python 3  
- Standard `csv` and `os` libraries for file handling  
- CSV file (`library.csv`) as the storage backend  
- Git and GitHub for version control and hosting
## Project Structure
- `library_system.py` – main source code containing all functions and the menu.  
- `library.csv` – data file storing book records (created automatically if not present).  
- `statement.md` – problem statement and scope description.  
- `README.md` – this documentation file.
## How to Install & Run

1. Install Python 3 on your system.  
2. Clone the repository or download the project folder.  
3. Ensure that `library_system.py` and `library.csv` are in the same folder (create an empty `library.csv` file if needed).  
4. Open a terminal/command prompt in the project folder.  
5. Run:
